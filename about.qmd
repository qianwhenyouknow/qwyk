My name is **Qianwen Yu**, originally from China. I recently moved to France, where I am now pursuing my studies in data analysis at **Sciences Po Lille** in collaboration with **l’Ecole Centrale de Lille**.

This blog is a simple platform where I document my learnings in coding, data, and English language improvement. It serves as a tool for self-reflection, allowing me to learn and grow more efficiently. 

Your presence and feedback are appreciated as we both embark on this learning journey.
